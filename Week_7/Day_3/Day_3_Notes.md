## Summary

Learnt about the important of storing passwords safely (__not in plain text__ Source: [PlainTextOffenders](https://plaintextoffenders.com/faq/devs)) and why storing passwords in plain text is bad in the first place (Source: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1197417/why-are-plain-text-passwords-bad-and-how-do-i-convince-my-boss-that-his-treasur)).

Learnt the difference between encryption vs hashing. Passwords are encrypted using a special key but can also be decrypted using that same key. Hashing essentially means that passwords are mutated in such a way that they can never be changed back into their original form.

Salting is the process of changing your hashing method so that hackers have a harder time trying to match hashed passwords.

Learned about __sessions__ and the multiple ways it is used in web development ( cookie sessions, encrypted cookies, user sessions, etc).

Learnt how to uninstall packages in a npm project (Source: [Nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/learn/uninstalling-npm-packages)).
