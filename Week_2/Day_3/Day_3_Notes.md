## Summary

Learnt more about VSCode short keys and how they can help make coding more efficient ([VS Code Shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf))

Completed the Music Library challenge in Compass, which lead to a greater understand of how to manipulate objects.

Solidified how add key:value pairs to objects (Source: [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-add-a-new-item-to-an-object-at-a-specific-position-with-vanilla-js/))

```javascript
var lunch = {
  sandwich: 'turkey',
  drink: 'soda',
  chips: true
};

// This gets added after "lunch.chips" in the object
lunch.dessert = 'cookie';
```


Learnt to how use Objects.keys() to count the number of keys in an object (Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys))

```javascript
const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42,
  c: false
};

console.log(Object.keys(object1));
// expected output: Array ["a", "b", "c"]
```
